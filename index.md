> In an era defined by digital interdependence and contested information flows, **network geopolitics** emerges as a critical lens for understanding how infrastructure, regulation, and strategic behavior shape global power dynamics. This lab focuses on the intersection of digital sovereignty, infrastructure resilience, and institutional strategy—where policy meets technology under geopolitical pressure.



At the core of this research agenda is the work of **Dr. Yen-Hung Chen**, whose contributions have helped define how states respond to infrastructure-based strategic vulnerabilities in the internet and telecommunications sectors. His experience bridges national policy design and scholarly inquiry into the governance of digital networks.

# Yen-Hung Chen

## Professional Background

Dr. Yen-Hung Chen is a policy researcher whose work lies at the intersection of **agenda-setting strategy and network geopolitics**. He specializes in the formulation of national strategies to address systemic challenges in the internet and telecommunications sectors. His expertise spans telecommunications performance evaluation, digital infrastructure development, and regulatory frameworks—domains critical to navigating the evolving interplay between technological innovation and institutional adaptation.

His research and policy contributions tackle the complexities of **network interdependence, global power asymmetries, and contested digital sovereignties**, with a focus on the shifting landscape of internet governance. Dr. Chen’s work engages with core issues of **network-centric statecraft**, including spectrum regulation, critical infrastructure security, and the governance of information flows.

During his tenure at the Executive Yuan of the Republic of China, Dr. Chen played a key role in shaping the country’s telecommunications agenda amid intensifying global competition over digital infrastructure. He served as a principal architect of Taiwan’s 4G and 5G policy frameworks, authored the nation's first national spectrum supply plan, and drafted its inaugural public policy document on spectrum governance. These initiatives helped **mitigate strategic vulnerabilities at the national level associated with infrastructure dependence**.

His dual engagement in policymaking and academic research has produced several internationally recognized publications, including:

1. **Drafting spectrum policy in an access-price targeting perspective**, *Computer Standards & Interfaces*, Vol. 62, 2019.  
   DOI: [10.1016/j.csi.2018.11.003](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csi.2018.11.003) \| [Download PDF](j.csi.2018.11.003.pdf)

2. **Impossible trinity: A guideline to shape telecommunication policy**, *Computer Standards & Interfaces*, Vol. 65, 2019.  
   DOI: [10.1016/j.csi.2019.03.006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csi.2019.03.006) \| [Download PDF](j.csi.2019.03.006.pdf)

Since leaving public office in 2016, Dr. Chen has remained active as an academic and policy advisor, contributing to national strategies in **telecommunications resource governance, information security, and network resilience**. He currently serves as a faculty member in the Department of Information Management at the National Taipei University of Nursing and Health Sciences.

## 💻 Long-term Projects

### 🔧 [Network Sovereignty through National Spectrum Planning](#)

> 1. Spectrum governance forms the backbone of digital sovereignty, influencing both domestic connectivity and international alignments.  
> 2. This project operationalized **ITU-recommended methodologies** using **Python** to model multi-band spectrum demand across various network scenarios and geostrategic contexts.  
> 3. By combining quantitative simulation with institutional analysis, the study demonstrated how spectrum policy can mitigate reliance on foreign infrastructure and strengthen **sovereign control over critical digital pathways**.

### 🌐 [Policy Wargaming in Network Geopolitical Scenarios](#)

> 1. Policy wargaming enables decision-makers to simulate strategic behaviors across interconnected digital and geopolitical domains—particularly where **network chokepoints and regulatory asymmetries** impact national interests.  
> 2. In complex domains such as next-generation telecom infrastructure, AI standards, and cross-border data flows, traditional planning methods often fall short in addressing adversarial strategies and systemic uncertainty.  
> 3. This project leveraged Generative AI (OpenAI, DeepSeek) to support **scenario evolution, adversarial logic modeling, and strategic response generation**. Prompt engineering was used to structure stakeholder roles and simulate competing policy rationales.  
> 4. This methodology equips governments to **stress-test infrastructure decisions**, anticipate **network-based coercion**, and co-develop adaptive policies with **enhanced geopolitical foresight**.
