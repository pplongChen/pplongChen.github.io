# Yen-Hung Chen
## Professional Background

Dr. Yen-Hung Chen is a policy researcher with a specialization in **the strategic use of agenda-setting to advance the objectives of senior government officials**. His work focuses on the formulation of national-level strategies in response to systemic challenges within the internet and telecommunications sectors. His expertise spans internet governance, digital infrastructure development, and regulatory frameworks—areas critical to addressing the dynamic interplay between technological advancement and institutional transformation.

Dr. Chen formerly served in the Executive Yuan of the Republic of China (Taiwan), where he played a pivotal role in shaping the nation’s telecommunications agenda. He was a key contributor to the development of Taiwan’s 4G and 5G policy frameworks, authoring the country’s first national spectrum supply plan and leading the drafting of Taiwan’s inaugural public policy document on spectrum governance. His dual engagement in both policy practice and academic research has led to a number of internationally recognized publications, including:

1. **Drafting spectrum policy in an access-price targeting perspective**, *Computer Standards & Interfaces*, Vol. 62, 2019.  
   DOI: [10.1016/j.csi.2018.11.003](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csi.2018.11.003) \| [Download PDF](j.csi.2018.11.003.pdf)

2. **Impossible trinity: A guideline to shape telecommunication policy**, *Computer Standards & Interfaces*, Vol. 65, 2019.  
   DOI: [10.1016/j.csi.2019.03.006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csi.2019.03.006) \| [Download PDF](j.csi.2019.03.006.pdf)

Since departing from public service in 2016, Dr. Chen has continued to serve as an academic and policy advisor, contributing to national policy planning and advisory initiatives in the fields of telecommunications resource management and information security. He is currently a faculty member in the Department of Information Management at the National Taipei University of Nursing and Health Sciences.

## 💻 Long-term Projects

### 🔧 [National-level analyses of spectrum demand and supply](#)

> 1. Reliable spectrum policy requires forward-looking demand estimation and transparent allocation strategies.  
> 2. To this end, national-level spectrum analysis provides a critical foundation for regulatory and industrial planning.  
> 3. This project operationalized **ITU-recommended methodologies** using **Python** to simulate multi-band spectrum demand across time horizons.  
> 4. The study also integrated qualitative assessments to account for institutional and behavioral uncertainties, thereby enhancing the comprehensiveness and policy relevance of spectrum allocation models.

### 🌐 [Policy Wargaming for Strategic Development](#)

> 1. Policy wargaming is a critical method for simulating complex strategic behavior and evaluating the robustness of regulatory frameworks under dynamic conditions.  
> 2. In domains such as telecommunications policy, where decisions involve long-term institutional trade-offs, competing stakeholder interests, and high degrees of uncertainty, conventional scenario planning often falls short.  
> 3. This project integrated Generative AI technologies—including both proprietary models (e.g., OpenAI) and open-source large language models (e.g., DeepSeek)—to support narrative construction, regulatory stress-testing, and adversarial scenario evolution. Prompt engineering techniques were employed to guide model behavior, structure stakeholder simulations, and tailor responses to varied policy logics.  
> 4. By combining AI-enhanced simulation with strategic prompt design, the methodology empowers policymakers to uncover blind spots, rehearse high-stakes decisions, and collaboratively **design adaptive policy agenda with improved strategic foresight**.
